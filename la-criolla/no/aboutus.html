            <p>La Criolla team form a group of expeditioners full of curiosity about Peru. </p>

                <p>Conscious of the lack of connection, we want to humbly take on the great challenge of getting to know and, in some cases,
                getting to know again this beautiful country replete with unique ingredients, landscapes, culture, tradition, and history, but above all those that live there and tell about them.
                </p>

                <p>Our collaborative team works hard to create links, and tries to make visible those elements that in daily life not everyone can see.
                </p>

                <p>The expedition we undertake has no destination or end, but centers on the constant movement in the observation and the respect of the temporality and the seasonality that Earth dictates.
            </p>
            <h1>VISION</h1>
            <p>We opened La Criolla with the dream of presenting the wide diversity and fusion of Peruvian food, using the best
                and most authentic ingredients, in a modern presentation. Peruvian cuisine fuses many different ethnicities,
                including Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and African, and is increasingly being recognized as world class.</p>
